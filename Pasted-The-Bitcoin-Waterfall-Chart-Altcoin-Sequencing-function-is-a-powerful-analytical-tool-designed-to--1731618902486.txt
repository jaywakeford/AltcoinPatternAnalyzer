Use Case Scenario
Imagine Bitcoin's market dominance begins to wane after a prolonged bull run. The Bitcoin Waterfall Chart & Altcoin Sequencing function activates its historical analysis, identifying that as BTC dominance decreases by specific percentages, certain altcoins historically gained significant market caps. The app visually presents this sequence, suggesting that users purchase Altcoin A, followed by Altcoin B, and then Altcoin C. As each altcoin reaches predefined gain milestones, the app recommends exiting the position and reallocating funds to the next altcoin in the sequence. Additionally, users can toggle between different investment narratives, such as DeFi-focused cohorts or NFT-centric groups, to tailor their investment strategy to their interests.
