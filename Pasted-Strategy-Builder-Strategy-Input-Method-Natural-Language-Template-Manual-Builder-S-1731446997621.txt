Rob's 15-Minute Reversal Trade

Entry Conditions:

Primary Signal: Buy when a bullish reversal candlestick pattern, such as a Hammer or Bullish Engulfing, forms on the 15-minute chart following a clear downtrend. This candle should have a long lower wick, indicating a rejection of lower prices.
Additional Confirmations: RSI below 30 to confirm oversold conditions, and volume above the 15-minute average (at least 1.2 times the 20-bar average) to strengthen the validity of the reversal.
Exit Conditions:

Primary Exit: Sell when the price reaches a recent resistance level or a key moving average (e.g., the 50-period MA on the 15-minute chart).
Safety Exits: Exit if a bearish reversal candle forms, if RSI rises above 70 (indicating overbought conditions), or if the price falls below the 50-period moving average.
Position Management:

Position Size: 10% of total capital for each trade.
Maximum Positions: 1 position at a time to manage risk and exposure.
Risk Management:

Stop Loss: Set stop loss at 1% below the entry price to limit potential losses on rapid reversals.
Take Profit: Set take profit at 2-3% above the entry price to capture gains from the reversal.
Trailing Stop: Optional 0.5% trailing stop after the position gains 1%, allowing gains to lock in while the position has upward momentum.
Trading Schedule:

Timeframe: 15-minute timeframe, ideal for intraday reversals.
Trading Hours: Focus on high volatility periods or market hours that exhibit strong volume, such as 9:30 AM - 11:30 AM and 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM.
