Rob's 15-Minute Reversal Trade

1. Entry Conditions
Primary Signal:

Buy when a bullish reversal candlestick pattern (e.g., Hammer, Bullish Engulfing) forms on the 15-minute chart following a clear downtrend. This candle should ideally show a long lower wick, indicating rejection of lower prices.
Math for Primary Signal:

Calculate the candle wick ratio:
Lower Wick Ratio
=
Low - Open
Close - Open
Lower Wick Ratio= 
Close - Open
Low - Open
​
 
For a reversal pattern, set a threshold where the Lower Wick Ratio is greater than or equal to 1.5.
Confirmation Signals:

RSI Confirmation: RSI should be below 30 at the close of the reversal candle, indicating oversold conditions.
Calculate RSI for the last 14 periods:
RSI
=
100
−
(
100
1
+
Average Gain
Average Loss
)
RSI=100−( 
1+ 
Average Loss
Average Gain
​
 
100
​
 )
Volume Confirmation: Volume should be above the 15-minute average volume for added strength in the reversal.
Calculate the 15-minute average volume over the last 20 bars:
Average Volume
=
∑
Volume of last 20 bars
20
Average Volume= 
20
∑Volume of last 20 bars
​
 
Set a threshold: Volume of the current bar should be at least 1.2 times the Average Volume.
2. Exit Conditions
Primary Exit:

Sell when the price reaches the nearest resistance level or a key moving average (e.g., 50-period MA on the 15-minute chart).
Math for Primary Exit:

Calculate the 50-period moving average:
50-period SMA
=
∑
Close of last 50 bars
50
50-period SMA= 
50
∑Close of last 50 bars
​
 
Exit when the close price is within 0.5% of the 50-period SMA or resistance level.
Safety Exits:

RSI Exit: Exit if RSI goes above 70, indicating overbought conditions.
Bearish Reversal Exit: Exit if a bearish reversal pattern (e.g., Shooting Star, Bearish Engulfing) forms.
Bearish Reversal Formula: Apply similar wick ratio as the entry but for upper wicks:
Upper Wick Ratio
=
High - Close
Close - Open
≥
1.5
Upper Wick Ratio= 
Close - Open
High - Close
​
 ≥1.5
3. Position Size
Fixed Position Size: Use 10% of the available capital for each trade. This keeps position size consistent and manageable.
4. Risk Management
Stop Loss:

Set an initial stop loss at 1% below the entry price.
Math for Stop Loss Level:
Stop Loss
=
Entry Price
×
(
1
−
0.01
)
Stop Loss=Entry Price×(1−0.01)
Take Profit:

Target a take profit level of 2-3% above the entry price.
Math for Take Profit Level: \text{Take Profit} = \text{Entry Price} \times (1 + \text{Target %})
Where Target % is typically 0.02 or 0.03.
Trailing Stop: Optional trailing stop of 0.5% once the trade is up by 1%.

Math for Trailing Stop Level:
Set the trailing stop to move up with price as long as the price is above 1% from entry:
Trailing Stop
=
Current Price
×
(
1
−
0.005
)
Trailing Stop=Current Price×(1−0.005)
5. Timeframe
15-Minute Timeframe: This strategy is designed specifically for intraday reversals and is best applied on a 15-minute timeframe.
6. Additional Indicators
Volume Requirements: Confirm that the current volume is at least 1.2 times the 20-bar average volume to validate the strength of the reversal pattern.
7. Market Phase Filters
Trade Only During High Volatility Periods: This strategy works best during volatile market conditions where price movement is more pronounced. Define market volatility based on the Average True Range (ATR) over the last 15 periods:
ATR
=
∑
(True Range of last 15 bars)
15
ATR= 
15
∑(True Range of last 15 bars)
​
 
Set a threshold: Only enter trades if the ATR is above a certain value relative to the asset's price (e.g., ATR > 1% of the current price).
