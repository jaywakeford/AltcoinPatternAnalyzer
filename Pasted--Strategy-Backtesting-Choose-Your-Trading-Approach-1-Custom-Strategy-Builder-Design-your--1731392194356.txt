Strategy Description

trategy Description: Moving Average Crossover with RSI Confirmation for BTC

Entry Conditions:

Buy when the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA, indicating a potential upward trend (Golden Cross).
Confirm entry with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 70 to avoid overbought conditions.
Exit Conditions:

Sell when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, indicating a potential downward trend (Death Cross).
Alternatively, exit if the RSI goes above 70, suggesting overbought conditions that may precede a reversal.
Position Size:

Use a 30% position size of total capital for each trade to manage exposure and reduce risk.
Risk Management:

Set a stop loss at 5% below the entry price to protect against significant losses.
Take profit when the price reaches 15% above the entry to capture gains while minimizing risk of reversal.
Optional Information:

Timeframe: Apply this strategy on the daily timeframe for longer-term trend confirmation.
Additional Indicators: Monitor volume for confirmation; higher volume on crossover events strengthens the buy/sell signal.
Market Phase Filters: Only apply the strategy when Bitcoin is above its 200-day SMA, indicating a general uptrend to align trades with the broader market direction.
This approach seeks to capture major upward movements while mitigating downside risks using a combination of moving averages, RSI, and volume as key indicators.
